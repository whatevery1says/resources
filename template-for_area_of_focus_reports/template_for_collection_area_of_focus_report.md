_As we have been completing research for our areas of focus, the WE1S RAs have brought up thought-provoking questions and reflections about representativeness, canonicity, source availability, and the source collection process. This form is meant to provide a space for RAs to keep track of their reflections, which may in the future provide a foundation for more in-depth research reports._

_Please answer the following questions about your area of research focus as you proceed with your research, and feel free to add additional reflections to section 6 below. This report will eventually be published on the WE1S public Web site._

_Please avoid fancy formatting (special fonts, colors, tables, spacing adjustments, etc., since this Word document will eventually be converted into Markdown before being posted online._
