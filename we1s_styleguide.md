## Citation Rules and Guidelines

These rules and guidelines are based on current standards in the [MLA Handbook 8th edition](https://www.mla.org/MLA-Style/What-s-New-in-the-Eighth-Edition) and [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/14/).

### Rules to Keep in Mind (including recent changes in MLA style)

### Formatting of Citations in a Bibliography

1. For a source with three or more authors, list only the first author's last name followed by "et al." For example: "Algee-Hewitt et al. 3".
1. Use DOI instead of URL when available.
1. When using URL, eliminate "[https://](https://)" and begin URL with "www."
1. Include date of access whenever possible.
1. Publication date and date of access should be formatted as follows: Day, Month, Year. For example: "Accessed 9 May 2012."
1. Months with four or fewer letters are not abbreviated (e.g. May, June, and July), but the remaining months are abbreviated as follows: Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec.
1. When citing a Tweet, include date and time of posting using reader's time zone.
1. If YouTube author's name is the same as the uploader's name, only cite the author once.

### Formatting of Citations in Endnotes (with Accompanying Bibliography)

WE1S prefers endnotes rather than footnotes so that documents can be posted easily in a variety of formats, including HTML Web pages where only endnotes are possible.

1. Endnotes use short citation form that refer the reader to the bibliography. In endnotes, cite by author last name, short title (if citing more than one work by the same author or for sources with no author), and page number. For example: "Guillory 30", or "Guillory, _Cultural Capital_, 30".
1. Refrain from the outdated use of "Ibid." in notes for the second mention of the same work and page location with no intervening entries. Use author, short title (if necessary), and page number as indicated above instead.
1. Use superscript numerals corresponding to endnotes that will appear at the bottom of the report under the title "Notes."

### Permissions Language

1. Any special image or content permissions language should be placed at the bottom of the applicable document in a section titled "Permissions Language." Indicate which image or content the permissions language refers to. For example:

+ Figure 2. Source: [source title]. Used by permission.
+ Figure 2. Source: [source title]. Â© [author name], used by permission.
+ Figure 2. Source: [source title]. CC BY-SA license.

## Common Source Citation Format Standards (with Examples)

## WE1S Style Rules and Guidelines (for projects, tools, and other sources without current citation standards)

### Projects

WE1S does not italicize project, tool, protocol, or similar titles.

+ Voice of the Shuttle. Home page, n. d. University of California, Santa  Barbara. [http://vos.ucsb.edu/](http://vos.ucsb.edu/). Accessed 30 Apr. 2017.
+ The Orlando Project. Home page, 2010. [http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/orlando/](http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/orlando/).  Accessed 5 Feb. 2017.

Exceptions to the above format, e.g., to cite project leaders or developers, are allowed if a project requests or suggests a particular citation. Other exceptions include omitting institution or organization hosting the project if that information is unclear or too complicated, as in the case of projects with multiple partners.

### Tools

To be most helpful to users, list in a bibliography under the tool name rather than creator name. (Add an alternative tool name in parenthesis if the tool is better or equivalently known by a different name). If the site for a tool requests that citation be by creator, add a cross-reference under the tool name to the listing under the creator name, unless the bibliography is short. Also, creator or developer names can be omitted if there is no clear set of creators or if there are too many developers in varying roles. Institution or organization name may also be omitted if there are too many involved.
